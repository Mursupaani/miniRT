# For files
/**
 * @file YourFileName.h
 * @brief A brief, one-line description of what this file does.
 *
 * Mainly just maybe use the two above, but if you think there is need for
 * a more verbose description of what this file and it's contents do
 * provide it here.
 *
 * Exposes:
 * - function_one()
 * - function_two()
 * - another_function()
 *
 * In case of main.c which usually contains only main().
 * Defines:
 * - main()
 *
 * @section file_commands Common File-Level Commands
 * A list of common "commands" you would use for Doxygen, but for our purposes I think
 * @file, @brief, and Exposes list is sufficient.
 *
 * - @file: Marks the comment as a file header (should be first).
 * - @brief: A short summary.
 * - @author: The author's name.
 * - @version: The file's version.
 * - @date: The date of the last significant update.
 * - @copyright: Copyright information.
 * - @mainpage: Makes this the main page of the documentation (use in one file only).
 * - @see: Refer to another file, function, or documentation.
 * - @note: Add a special note.
 * - @warning: Add a warning.
 * - @defgroup: Group related items (files, functions, etc.) together.

# For Functions
 /**
 * This comment is intended for functions, to be inserted above them.
 * I think we will only need to use:
 *	- @brief one line description of the Function
 *	- @param list the parameters the function takes
 *	- @return what is the return value of the function
 *	- @note if there are some special considerations for use of the function
 *
 * @brief A short, one-line description of what this function does.
 *
 * A more detailed description of the function's behavior, algorithms used,
 * preconditions (what must be true before calling), postconditions
 * (what will be true after calling), and any side effects.
 *
 * @param [in] input_param      Description of an input parameter. Specify its purpose,
 * valid range, and units (if any).
 * @param [out] output_param    Description of an output parameter (e.g., a buffer
 * to be filled, a pointer to a result).
 * @param [in,out] io_param     Description of a parameter that is read from and
 * written to.
 *
 * @return Description of the return value (e.g., 'true' on success, 'false' on
 * failure, or the calculated value).
 * For void functions, you can state 'None.' or omit the @return tag.
 *
 * @note A special note about usage, performance, or non-obvious behavior.
 * @warning Describe any potential dangers, common errors, or exceptions.
 * @see related_function()
 *
 * @section func_commands Common Function-Level Commands
 * A reference for common Doxygen commands used at the function level:
 * - @brief: Short summary.
 * - @param [in/out/in,out] name: Describes a function parameter.
 * - @return (or @returns): Describes the return value.
 * - @tparam: Describes a template parameter (for C++).
 * - @pre: Describes a precondition that must be met.
 * - @post: Describes a postcondition that will be true after execution.
 * - @exception (or @throw): Describes an exception that may be thrown.
 * - @see: Refers to related documentation or code.
 * - @note: Adds a special note.
 * - @warning: Adds a warning.
 * - @deprecated: Marks the function as deprecated.

 # Structs
/**
 * @struct s_app_state
 * @brief Holds all persistent data and state for the application.
 *
 * Provide more details here if needed
 *
 * @note This struct is typically forward-declared in header files and
 * typedef'd to `t_app` for convenience.
 *
 * @see initialize_app()
 * @see free_app_memory()
